This is a CSS styling for [Marked](http://markedapp.com/) based on color schemes from [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by @ethanschoonover

If you have `Automatic Syntax Highlighting` turned on in your Marked preferences, toggling the contrast may look strange. 

See the [Marked Extras page](http://markedapp.com/extras/) for more on how to install custom styles.
